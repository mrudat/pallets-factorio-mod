[Pallets](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pallets) updated for Factorio 1.0.

A Factorio mod that allows you to load items onto pallets, and later unload them.
This makes it possible to greatly increase the throughput of a factory using belts.

Each pallet holds a single stack of items, and does not itself stack, so only belt and inserter throughput will change.

Loading and unloading pallets is very similar to filling and emptying barrels. It is done in an assembling machine. Recipes for loading and unloading are automatically created, so the mod should be compatible with other mods that introduce new items.

Loaded pallets themselves do not stack, so throughput of trains does not change when using pallets. But loading and unloading trains can be significantly faster.

Using pallets requires research to unlock.
